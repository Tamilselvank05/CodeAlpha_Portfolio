**TASK 1: PORTFOLIO**

**_Description:_** I recently finished building my personal portfolio website. It was a straightforward but challenging project. I used the website as an online resume to highlight my experience, skills, and expertise. The process required careful attention to detail, especially in making sure everything looked good and was easy to use. It was a great learning experience that helped me improve my front-end development skills while creating something that represents me well.
